class LocationList(LocationSequence, list):
    """List of agentpy objects.

    Attribute calls and assignments are applied to all agents
    and return an :class:`AttrIter` with the attributes of each agent.
    This also works for method calls, which returns a list of return values.
    Arithmetic operators can further be used to manipulate agent attributes,
    and boolean operators can be used to filter the list based on agents'
    attributes. Standard :class:`list` methods can also be used.

    Arguments:
        model (Model): The model instance.
        objs (int or Sequence, optional):
            An integer number of new objects to be created,
            or a sequence of existing objects (default empty).
        cls (type, optional): Class for the creation of new objects.
        **kwargs:
            Keyword arguments are forwarded
            to the constructor of the new objects.
            Keyword arguments with sequences of type :class:`AttrIter` will be
            broadcasted, meaning that the first value will be assigned
            to the first object, the second to the second, and so forth.
            Otherwise, the same value will be assigned to all objects.

    Examples:
        Prepare an :class:`AgentList` with three agents::

            >>> model = ap.Model()
            >>> agents = model.add_agents(3)
            >>> agents
            AgentList [3 agents]

        The assignment operator can be used to set a variable for each agent.
        When the variable is called, an :class:`AttrList` is returned::

            >>> agents.x = 1
            >>> agents.x
            AttrList of 'x': [1, 1, 1]

        One can also set different variables for each agent
        by passing another :class:`AttrList`::

            >>> agents.y = ap.AttrIter([1, 2, 3])
            >>> agents.y
            AttrList of 'y': [1, 2, 3]

        Arithmetic operators can be used in a similar way.
        If an :class:`AttrList` is passed, different values are used for
        each agent. Otherwise, the same value is used for all agents::

            >>> agents.x = agents.x + agents.y
            >>> agents.x
            AttrList of 'x': [2, 3, 4]

            >>> agents.x *= 2
            >>> agents.x
            AttrList of 'x': [4, 6, 8]

        Attributes of specific agents can be changed through setting items::

            >>> agents.x[2] = 10
            >>> agents.x
            AttrList of 'x': [4, 6, 10]

        Boolean operators can be used to select a subset of agents::

            >>> subset = agents(agents.x > 5)
            >>> subset
            AgentList [2 agents]

            >>> subset.x
            AttrList of attribute 'x': [6, 8]
