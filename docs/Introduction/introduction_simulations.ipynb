    "As the weights can now change in every time step, we have to make sure that the weights are updated in every time step.\n",
    "Therefore we add the line `self.update_weights(location_labels=[\"Home\", \"School\", \"Work\"])` to `model.step()` which updates the edge weights between all agents and locations of the types `Home`, `School` and `Work` in every time step."
