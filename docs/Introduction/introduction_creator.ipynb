    "The combination of agents and locations that exist in a model makes the life of an agent-based modeler much easier.\n",
    "Managing the relationships between agents in agent-based models is now very convenient.\n",
    "However, it is still very tedious to connect a large number of agents through a specific network structure.\n",
    "This is where the real magic of Pop2net comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pop2net enables you to design a specific network structure by the definition of a special kind of class: the `LocationDesigner`.\n",
    "A `LocationDesigner` can be considered as an *interface* with a special syntax to create a certain number of location instances that connect specific agents in a specific way.\n",
    "The assignment of agents to locations by the definition of a `LocationDesigner` is primarely done through agent attributes.\n",
    "Hence, **the creation of networks using pop2net makes the most sense when agents have informative attributes.**\n",
    "However, even when the agents in your simulation do not have any attributes the `LocationDesigner` class makes it easy to quickly connect agents in a certain way, for instance using classic network models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of the network based on what is defined in a `LocationDesigner` is managed by the `Creator` class.\n",
    "The `Creator` *reads* the definition of a `LocationDesigner` and translates it into a certain number of certain location instances and then assigns the agents to the corresponding location instances."

    "Important to know is that while the generation of locations highly depents on the agents and their attributes, the generation of agents is independent from the generation of locations and their connection.\n",

If you plan to create your agents in your own way and just want to connect your agents using Pop2net and the Creator class, you can skip this subsection! However, to connect agents using Pop2net, they must always inherit from the Pop2net agent class.\n",
