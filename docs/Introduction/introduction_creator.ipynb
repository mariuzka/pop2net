    "The combination of agents and locations that exist in a model makes the life of an agent-based modeler much easier.\n",
    "Managing the relationships between agents in agent-based models is now very convenient.\n",
    "However, it is still very tedious to connect a large number of agents through a specific network structure.\n",
    "This is where the real magic of Popy comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popy enables you to design a specific network structure by the definition of a special kind of location class: the `MagicLocation` class.\n",
    "A `MagicLocation` can be considered as an *Interface* with a special syntax to create a certain number of location instances that connect specific agents in a specific way.\n",
    "The assignment of agents to locations by the definition of a `MagicLocation` is primarely done through agent attributes.\n",
    "Hence, **the creation of networks using Popy makes the most sense when agents have informative attributes.**\n",
    "However, even when the agents in your simulation do not have any attributes the `MagicLocation` class makes it easy to quickly connect agents in a certain way, for instance using classic network models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of the network based on what is defined in a `MagicLocation` is managed by the `Creator` class.\n",
    "The `Creator` *reads* the definition of a `MagicLocation` and translates it into a certain number of certain location instances and then assigns the agents to the corresponding location instances."

    "\n",
    "Although the main task of Popy and the `Creator` class is connecting existing agents via the definition of `MagicLocation`s, the `Creator` can also generate agents for you.\n",
    "A special feature of the `Creator` class is that it has some convenient methods to create agents based on micro-level data.\n",
    "This makes it easy to create *empirical* agents from survey data, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to know is that while the generation of locations highly depents on the agents and their attributes, the generation of agents is independent from the generation of locations and their connection.\n",
    "This may be different from classic network generators in which you generate nodes and edges in one step.\n",
    "\n",
