Welcome to Pop2net's documentation!
===================================

**Pop2net** is a new software package for Python that simplifies the creation of network structures for agent-based models.
Using a simple syntax, Pop2net makes it easy to determine how links between certain (groups of) agents are formed by defining contact layers.
Due to its possible integration into `Mesa <https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/>` and `AgentPy <https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ , networks built with Pop2net can be directly used to run simulations.
Pop2net also offers tools to create populations of agents based on empirical micro-data and to validate network properties.
