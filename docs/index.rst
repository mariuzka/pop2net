Welcome to Popy's documentation!
================================

**Popy** is a new software package for Python that simplifies the creation of network structures for agent-based models. 
Using a simple syntax, Popy makes it easy to determine how links between certain (groups of) agents are formed by defining contact layers. 
Due to its full integration into `AgentPy <https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ , networks built with Popy can be directly used to run simulations. 
Popy also offers tools to create populations of agents based on empirical micro-data and to validate network properties.

.. note::
      This project is under very active development and still in it's early stages.
