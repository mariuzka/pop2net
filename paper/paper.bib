	abstract = {Thomas C. Schelling introduced a simple mathematical model to address the phenomenon of social segregation as a consequence of a natural evolution of elementary local rules. This model became a good framework to understand how local rules, like the selection of a better neighborhood for life, can produce macro-behaviors, like segregation in a population with different kind of individuals. In this work, with the aid of the Schelling's model, we characterize the dynamical evolution of segregation in random networks; analyze the performance of some segregation indices and the dynamics of this model for various network degrees. Finally, we provide probabilistic arguments to explain quantitatively the behavior of the dynamic of Schelling's segregation model in networks.},

Covasim includes demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing, hygiene measures, and protective equipment; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine disease dynamics and policy options in Africa, Europe, Oceania, and North America.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Geographically-explicit simulations have become crucial in understanding cities and are playing an important role in Urban Science. One such approach is that of agent-based modeling which allows us to explore how agents interact with the environment and each other (e.g., social networks), and how through such interactions aggregate patterns emerge (e.g., disease outbreaks, traffic jams). While the use of agent-based modeling has grown, one challenge remains, that of creating realistic, geographically-explicit, synthetic populations which incorporate social networks. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel method to create a synthetic population which incorporates social networks using the New York Metro Area as a test area. To demonstrate the generalizability of our synthetic population method and data to initialize models, three different types of agent-based models are introduced to explore a variety of urban problems: traffic, disaster response, and the spread of disease. These use cases not only demonstrate how our geographically-explicit synthetic population can be easily utilized for initializing agent populations which can explore a variety of urban problems, but also show how social networks can be integrated into such populations and large-scale simulations.},

Synthetic data have become an important instrument for ex-ante assessments of policy impact. The performance and acceptability of such a tool relies heavily on the quality of the synthetic populations, i.e., on the statistical similarity between the synthetic and the true population of interest. Multiple approaches and tools have been developed to generate synthetic data. These approaches can be categorized into three main groups: synthetic reconstruction, combinatorial optimization, and model-based generation. We provide in this paper a brief overview of these approaches, and introduce simPop, an open source data synthesizer. simPop is a user-friendly R package based on a modular object-oriented concept. It provides a highly optimized S4 class implementation of various methods, including calibration by iterative proportional ﬁtting and simulated annealing, and modeling or data fusion by logistic regression. We demonstrate the use of simPop by creating a synthetic population of Austria, and report on the utility of the resulting data. We conclude with suggestions for further development of the package.},

	abstract = {Population censuses are vital to public policy decision-making. They provide insight into human resources, demography, culture, and economic structure at local, regional, and national levels. However, such surveys are very expensive (especially for low and middle-income countries with high populations, such as India), time-consuming, and may also raise privacy concerns, depending upon the kinds of data collected. In light of these issues, we introduce SynthPop++, a novel hybrid framework, which can combine data from multiple real-world surveys (with different, partially overlapping sets of attributes) to produce a real-scale synthetic population of humans. Critically, our population maintains family structures comprising individuals with demographic, socioeconomic, health, and geolocation attributes: this means that our ``fake'' people live in realistic locations, have realistic families, etc. Such data can be used for a variety of purposes: we explore one such use case, Agent-based modelling of infectious disease in India. To gauge the quality of our synthetic population, we use both machine learning and statistical metrics. Our experimental results show that synthetic population can realistically simulate the population for various administrative units of India, producing real-scale, detailed data at the desired level of zoom -- from cities, to districts, to states, eventually combining to form a country-scale synthetic population.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling holds great potential as an analytical tool. Agent-based models (ABMs) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into ABMs. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in ABMs of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining ABMs with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.},

	abstract = {Computational social science and in particular agent-based social simu-lation continue to gain momentum in the academic community. Social network analysis enjoys even more popularity. They both have much in common. In agent-based models, individual interactions are simulated to generate social patterns of all kinds, including relationships that can then be analyzed by social network analysis. This chapter describes and discusses the role of agent-based modeling in the generative-analytical part of this symbiosis. More precisely, we look at what concepts are used, how they are used (implemented), and what kind of validation procedures can be applied. Agent-based modeling and network analysis enjoy a symbiotic relationship in the field of computational social science. The former is a method of computationally representing individual interactions from which social patterns emerge; the latter is a method that affords (dynamic) structural analysis of (socio-) structural pat-terns. The renowned anthropologist Clyde Mitchell stated that the starting point of any analysis should be the actual relationships in which people are involved (Mitchell, 1989, pp.77-79). What he did not think of, interestingly, is to analyze, other than by observational and descriptive means, how these relationships form. Today, agent-based models (ABMs) are mostly implemented as object-oriented computer programs. They consist of autonomous agents that can be per-ceived as computer programs themselves. In principal, agents have three features: they behave and interact according to a given set of rules, possess cognitive capa-bilities to process information, and constitute their own environment (cf.},

Evoplex meets this need by providing a fast, robust and extensible platform for developing agent-based models and multi-agent systems on networks. Each agent is represented as a node and interacts with its neighbors, as defined by the network structure. Evoplex is ideal for modeling complex systems, for example in evolutionary game theory and computational social science.

	abstract = {In the standard situation of networked populations, link neighbours represent one of the main influences leading to social diffusion of behaviour. When distinct attributes coexist, not only the network structure, but also the distribution of these traits shape the typical neighbourhood of each individual. While assortativity refers to the formation of links between similar individuals inducing the network structure, here, we separate the formation of links from the actual distribution of an attribute on the topology. This is achieved by first generating different network types (e.g., lattice, scale free, and small world), followed by the procedure of distributing attributes. With this separation, we try to isolate the effect that attribute distribution has on network diffusion from the effect of the network structure itself. We compare random distributions, where behaviour types are highly mixed, and homophilic distributions, where similar individuals are very likely to be linked, and examine the effects on social contagion in a population of mainly reciprocal behaviour types. In addition, we gradually mix homophilic distribution, by random rewiring, adding links and relocating individuals. Our main results is that attribute distribution strongly influences collective behaviour and the actual effect depends on the network type. Under homophilic distribution the equilibrium collective behaviour of a population tends to be more divers, implying that random distributions are limited for illustration of collective behaviour. We find that our results are robust when we use different gradual mixing methods on homophilic distribution.},

Making decisions under uncertainty, they all face the same temporal paradox: estimating the impact of NPIs before they have been implemented. Due to the limited variance of empirical cases, researchers could so far not disentangle effects of individual NPIs or their impact on different demographic groups. In this paper, we utilize large-scale agent-based simulations in combination with Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models to investigate the spread of COVID-19 for some of the most affected federal states in Germany. In contrast to other studies, we sample agents from a representative survey. Including more realistic demographic attributes that influence agents’ behavior yields accurate predictions of COVID-19 transmissions and allows us to investigate counterfactual what-if scenarios. Results show that quarantining infected people and exploiting industry-specific home office capacities are the most effective NPIs. Disentangling education-related NPIs reveals that each considered institution (kindergarten, school, university) has rather small effects on its own, yet, that combined openings would result in large increases in COVID-19 cases. Representative survey-characteristics of agents also allow us to estimate NPIs’ effects on different age groups. For instance, re-opening schools would cause comparatively few infections among the risk-group of people older than 60 years.},
